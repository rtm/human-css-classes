morass/modifiers/white-space.css

Break down `white-space` semantically.

I don't know about you, but I can never remember the values for `white-space`.
Every time I want to use one, I have to look it up again.
Actually, it's quite easy when you break it down.
The properties each indicate a combination of whether newlines are to be honored,
whether whitespace is to be preserved, and whether wrapping is desired.

These Morass micro-classes map those concepts into `white-space` values,
so hopefully you'll never have to consult that page again.

Classes defined:

honor-newline        Treat newlines as newlines.
preserve-whitespace  Do not collapse whitespace.
nowrap               Do not wrap.
white-space-normal   Set things back.
*/

/*
Honor newlines, but do not preserve whitespace and wrap.
This corresponds to the common case of displaying a user post.
*/
.honor-newline { white-space: pre-line; }

/*
Honor newlines while also preserving whitespace.
*/
.honor-newline.preserve-whitespace { white-space: pre-wrap; }

/*
Honor newlines, preserve whitespace, and do not wrap.
This replicates the behavior of `<pre>'.
You are probably better off using `pre`, although it will
also give you a monospaced font and vertical padding.
*/
.honor-newline.preserve-whitespace.nowrap { white-space: pre; }

/*
Without honoring newlines, no wrapping means that the output will be on a single line.
In this case, whitespace is never preserved.
CSS offers no alternative for preserving whitespace while not honoring newlines and not wrapping.
*/
.nowrap { white-space: nowrap; }

/*
`white-space` is an inherited property.
Therefore, in some obscure cases we may need a way to turn it off.
*/
.white-space-normal { white-space: normal; }
